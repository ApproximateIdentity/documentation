Changing And Recompiling Debian Packages
========================================

I'm going to use the example of gnome-terminal. It has a "feature" I find
extremely irritating. Basically if you type into the terminal while your cursor
is above the terminal window, it will hide your cursor. I would much rather
have it permanently visible, but this is a compile-time option. It is, however,
fairly easy to recompile the debian package with the necessary change.

First you need to install the following packages with apt:

    * debian-keyring - required to verify signatures when downloading source
        packages
    * devscripts - has all the stuff to build debian packages

First you need to make sure you have all the build dependencies:

    $ apt-get build-dep gnome-terminal

Next you need the source package itself:

    $ apt-get source gnome-terminal

This created the `gnome-terminal-3.14.1/` folder when I ran it. Go into the
`gnome-terminal-3.14.1/src` folder and edit the `terminal-screen.c` file. This
is the diff between the old and new files:

    $ $ diff terminal-screen.c.old terminal-screen.new
    382c382
    <   vte_terminal_set_mouse_autohide (terminal, TRUE);
    ---
    >   vte_terminal_set_mouse_autohide (terminal, FALSE);

After having replaced the old file I added my changes to the change log:

    $ dch --local thomas-autohide-off

    gnome-terminal (3.14.1-1+deb8u1thomas-autohide-off1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

      * Turns off autohiding of cursor. The default behavior is to hide the cursor
        if it is over the terminal screen and you type anything into the terminal.
        This is really annoying and this disables this "feature".

This information can be seen later here:

    $ zless /usr/share/doc/gnome-terminal/changelog.Debian.gz

Finally run this in the `gnome-terminal-3.14.1/` foler:

    $ dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us

Note that the `-b` is important because we don't have the original source (we
changed it) and the others tell it not to sign the packages.

Finally install the new debs by doing 

    $ sudo dpkg -i [...].deb
